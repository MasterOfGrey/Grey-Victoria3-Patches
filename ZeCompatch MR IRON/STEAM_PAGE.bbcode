*Removal will only work if safely if nobody is using the new pm's added to align with I.R.O.N.

This patch mod makes it so that Morgenrote's Uranium Mines have the same improved PM options as other mines when using the I.R.O.N. mod (which I highly recommend).

It is compatible with anything the base mods are compatible with, load order shouldn't matter.
