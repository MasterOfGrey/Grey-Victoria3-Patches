This patch mod makes it so that all ships in Timber to Steel can be upgraded to any higher tier of ship in their same class. This enables the AI to mostly update its fleets properly into the late game.

It is compatible with anything the base mods are compatible with, load order shouldn't matter.

[h3]Requires the original mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2981452537]Timber to Steel - Naval Expansion Mod[/url] and will cleanly patch it with the functions of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3092636193]Upgradable Everything[/url]. (Upgradeable Everything is not required if you don't want the features for land forces.)[/h3]
